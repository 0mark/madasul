[build]
$ make
and
$ make install
should work

[using]
Create a directory 'madasul' in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
A playlist is needed (defasult: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/madasul/list), to create one you can run 
$ mlg /path/to/your/music
To get meta tags, ogginfo and id3 are needed
The default config needs mpg321, ogg123 and mplayer for other formats
